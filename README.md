What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    The main problem that I was solving was that of choosing th right data structure for organizing and displaying course data from a Computer Science program in an efficient and alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    I approached this problem by using a Binary Search Tree (BST) in order to store and sort the courses by their alphanumeric course numbers, which made searching, inserting, and displaying the courses more efficient.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    One issue that came about duing project two was that when no prerequisites courses were shown, it simply showed a comma. I didnt like the format so I overcame this challenge with parsing the CSV input andy also by clearing up the parsing function to handle extra spaces and commas properly and add a None text.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    This project has helped to teach me the importance of choosing the right data structures based on the problem at hand.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    My work on these projects has helped me to focus on creating cleaner, more modular code. As well as having more clear responsibilities for each function, in doing this it makes the program easier to maintain and change in the future.
